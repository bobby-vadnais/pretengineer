The Pretengineer is kind of a blog, mostly written by [Jack Pearkes](http://jack.ly), but other
folks contribute. Each post has a list of contributors at the bottom.

You can see a list of all posts on the [index page](/).

The tools used here:

- [Github](https://github.com), for hosting, versioning, writing and contributions
- [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), for templating, markdown formatting and rendering of HTML
- An API used to display comments and contributor information from GitHub

Comments, questions or suggestions are best filed in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/pearkes/pretengineer/issues).
