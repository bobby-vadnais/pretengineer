### Contribute

Contributions, be it spelling, factual errors or argument modifications,
are highly encouraged.

You'll notice a list of "authors" at the bottom of each post. This data
comes from GitHub, so any change you make to the post will add you
to this list automatically.

### Make Changes

Fork the Pretengineer in Github and make your changes. Then, open a descriptive
pull request against this repo. All changes are appreciated, no matter how
small.

When changes are merged, they will automatically update http://pretengineer.com

If your change is small, I recommend using the edit functinality built into
Github. Go to the post or file you wish to edit and press the "Edit" button. You can
make your changes and commit with a message.

Once you've made your changes, when you visit the repository you should
see a "Pull Request" button appear. Click that and follow the flow.

### Run Locally

If you want to run the site locally to test how your changes look, you
may follow these instructions.

Install Jekyll, the static site builder:

    $ [sudo] gem install jekyll
    ...

Run the development server:

    $ jekyll serve -w
    ...

By default, the server runs on http://localhost:4000.
