### Make Changes

Fork the Pretengineer in Github and make your changes. Then, open a descriptive
pull request against this repo. All changes are appreciated, no matter how
small.

When changes are merged, they will automatically update http://pretengineer.com

If your change is small, I recommend using the edit functinality built into
Github. Go to the post or file you wish to edit and press the button. You can
make your changes and commit with a message.

Once you've made your changes, when you visit the repository you should
see a "Pull Request" button appear.
